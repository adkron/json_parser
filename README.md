# JsonParser

## Inspiration
I read Andrea Leopardi's great [article](http://andrealeopardi.com/posts/tokenizing-and-parsing-in-elixir-using-leex-and-yecc/) about tokenizing and parsing string and its actual utility in the real world.

After that, I decided to build a library that parses json formatted strings using this approach.

## Description
The Project allows to parse jsons through a the `mix` tasks provided or directly using the `JsonParser` module.
Read the docs for further information.

## Installation
TODO: complete and fix this

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `json_parser` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [{:json_parser, "~> 0.1.0"}]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/json_parser](https://hexdocs.pm/json_parser).
